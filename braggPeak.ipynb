    "When travelling in matter, heavy charged particles lose energy by interacting with atomic electrons. Their energy loss is described by the Bethe formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$-\\frac{dE}{dx} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0^2}NZ\\frac{z^2e^4}{m_e c^2 \\beta^2}\\left[ln\\left(\\frac{2m_ec^2\\gamma^2\\beta^2}{I}\\right) - \\beta^2\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ is the atom density of the target, $Z$ the charge of target nuclei, $z$ the charge of the incoming heavy charged particle, $m_e$ the mass of the electron, $\\gamma$ the Lorentz factor, $\\beta=v/c$ and $I$ the mean excitation energy of target atoms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using $r_e = \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 m_e c^2}$ ($r_e$ is the electron classical radius) and $N_e=NZ$ ($N_e$ is the electron density, i.e. the number of electrons per unit volume), the Bethe formula can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$-\\frac{dE}{dx} = 4\\pi m_e c^2 r_e^2 N_e\\frac{z^2}{\\beta^2}\\left[ln\\left(\\frac{2m_ec^2\\gamma^2\\beta^2}{I}\\right) - \\beta^2\\right]$$\n",

    "# Computation of the Bragg peak and proton range\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the Bethe formula, compute the energy loss as a function of depth of penetration in water for protons with a kinetic energy of $T=65$ MeV. Represent the result graphically (for this, use the `gonum/plot` package). Does it look like a Bragg peak ?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Data: for water, we have $I=78$ eV and $N_e=\\frac{\\rho_{water}N_A*10}{18}=3.34\\times 10^{23}$ electrons per cm$^{3}$. In this last formula, $\\rho$ is the density of water, $N_A$ the Avogadro's constant, $10$ the number of electrons per molecule and $18$ the mass of one mole ($18=2\\times1+16$).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute the $65$ MeV proton range. Repeat the same calculation for $T=100, 150, 200$ MeV.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ranges $R_1$ and $R_2$ of two particles of the same speed $\\beta$ are related by the following relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{R_1(\\beta)}{R_2(\\beta)} = \\frac{z_2^2 M_1}{z_1^2 M_2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    where $M_1$ and $M_2$ are the masses of the particles and $z_1$ and $z_2$ their charges. Check this formula using your program. For this, you can for example compare the range of the $65$ MeV proton already considered to the one of an $\\alpha$ particle of the same speed (the mass of the alpha particle is $3727$ MeV)."
